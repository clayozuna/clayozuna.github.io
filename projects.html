          <h1>Undergraduate Research</h1>
            <p>
              Spring 2018 I became involved in research under Dr. Kate Davis with Clare Lamers.
              In our research, we built a fully unified grid simulation from generation to distribution in MATLAB.
              We then tested use cases using Electric Vehicles as a generation source to help with peak shaving
              and, in extreme cases, blackout restoration.
            </p>
            <p>
              We used this research as our capstone and our senior thesis. From our research, we also became Undergraduate Research Scholars.
              Along the way, we learned how to write a 76-page senior thesis, present finding in a clear, concise manner, and submit both oral and written reports.
               You can read the paper <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9000257" target="_blank">here</a>

          <h1>Website</h1>
            <p>This website is an ongoing project since Summer 2018. I found my love for coding from my friend Josiah Coad Freshman year.
              In my free time, I like to work on this website and other coding projects to improve what I can do.
              If you want to check out what else I create feel free to check out my GitHub page <a href="https://github.com/clayozuna" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <h1>Course work</h1> <!--Need to include an intro section for courses-->
        <p>
          Below are courses that I found impactful throughout my college career and lessons I learned from them.
          I am still adding to this section!
        </p>
        <h3>ENGR 111</h3>
          <p>ENGR 111 was my first college engineering course. In the course, we learned how to draft by hand using compasses, protractors, and engineering scales.
            It provided me with a hands-on experience of what it was like to draft projects before Computer Aided Design (CAD).
            The best learning experience from the course was from the Rube Goldberg machine project.
            A Rube Goldberg machine is many simple machines like a lever put together to perform a simple task.
          </p>
          <p>
             We formed groups in the first class, a room full of freshman students,
            and worked on designing it the entire semester using skills learned from drafting and AutoCAD.
            Our final project was a 5'x 5'x 5' machine with 16 steps that could open an umbrella.
            Our budget was $100 and we kept the overall design under $60 while winning the most creative machine in class.
            From the project I learned how to work with team members from various backgrounds that I've never met before. I also became proficient using CAD.
          </p>
          <h3>ECEN 325</h3>
          <p>ECEN 325 taught me circuit analysis. The course taught me how to work with Bode plots, diodes, op-amps, BJTs, and MOSFETs.
            What I enjoyed most about the course is that lab revolves around using a kit to construct circuits where we solved for the transfer function, Bode plots, and components at certain frequencies.
            Simulations were created and tested on Multisim then compared with the actuals. Though the course itself was rigorous, I learned I really enjoy small-signal circuit analysis.
            It helped me breeze through the electronics portion of the FE exam.
          </p>
          <h3>ECEN 454</h3>
          <p>In ECEN 454, we focused on digital integrated circuit design. The course revolved around creating simple circuit components like a NAND or XOR gate from the transistor level
            using pMOS and nMOS.
            We are designed these components using Cadence.
            I enjoyed this class because it gave me a first-hand look at designing components with software I was not previously familiar with.
            It helped deepen my fundamental understanding of what is happening inside the components.
