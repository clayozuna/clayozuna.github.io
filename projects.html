          <h1>Website</h1>
            <p>This website is an ongoing project since Summer 2018. I found my love for coding from a friend freshman year. My passion for coding and web development kept it growing until I made the website you see today.
              Now in my free time, I like to work on the website to continue improving what I can do. If you want to check out what else I code feel free to check out my github page <a href="github.com/clayozuna" target="_blank">here.</a>
              I am always looking to grow my skills. If you have any comments or places where you think the site can be better, feel free to shoot me an email and I will get back to you soon as possible!

        <h1>Course work</h1>
          <p>Some notable coursework I have had over the years begins with engineering 111(ENGR 111). In the course, we learned how to draft by hand using compasses, protractors, and engineering scales.
            It provided me with a hands-on expereince of what it was like to draft drawings and I still pull skills from the class when I am working on Autodesk Inventor. One of the class projects that was a great learning experience
            was the Rube Goldberg machine, a complex machine that performs a simple task. We formed groups the first class, a room full of freshman students, and worked on designing it the entire semester. Our final project was a 5'x5'x5'
            machine with 16 steps that could open an umbrella. Our budget was $100 and we kept the overall design under $60 while winning the most creative design in the class.
          </p>
          <p>ECEN 325 is a course I am currently taking where we are learning the second part of electronic circuit theory. As of now, we have covered node analysis, op-amp functionality, and plotting Bode magnitudes and phases.
            What I enjoy most about the course is that lab revolves around using a kit to construct circuits that we have solved for the transfer function, Bode plots, and components at certain frequencies.
            Last week we solved for and constructed second order lowpass, highpass, and bandpass filters and measured input and output using WaveForms. Simulations were created and tested on MultiSim then compared with the actuals.
          </p>
          <p>In ECEN 454, another course I'm currently taking, we are focused on digital integrated circuit design. The course currently revolves around creating simple circuit components like a NAND or XOR gate from the transistor level
            using pMOS and nMOS. We are currently designing these components in Cadence.
