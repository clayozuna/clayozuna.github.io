            <p>
              I'm currently studying research under Dr. Kate Davis with Clare Lamers. Our project is focused on
              building a fully unified grid simulation from generation to distribution in MATLAB. From this,
              we can implement use cases using Electric Vehicles as a generation source to help with peak shaving
              and, in extreme cases, blackout restoration.

          <h1>Website</h1>
            <p>This website is an ongoing project since Summer 2018. I found my love for coding from a friend freshman year.
              Now in my free time, I like to work on this website to continue improving what I can do. If you want to check out what else I code feel free to check out my github page <a href="https://github.com/clayozuna" target="_blank">here</a>.
              I am always looking to grow my skills. If you have any comments or places where you think the site can be better, feel free to shoot me a message in the contact section and I will get back to you soon as possible.

        <h1>Course work</h1> <!--Need to include an intro section for courses-->
          <p>ENGR 111 was my first college engineering course. In the course, we learned how to draft by hand using compasses, protractors, and engineering scales.
            It provided me with a hands-on expereince of what it was like to draft projects before Autodesk. The best learning experience from the course was
            the Rube Goldberg machine. A Rube Goldberg machine is many simple machines like a lever put together to perform a simple task. We formed groups the first class, a room full of freshman students,
            and worked on designing it the entire semester using skills learned from drafting and AutoCad. Our final project was a 5'x 5'x 5'
            machine with 16 steps that could open an umbrella. Our budget was $100 and we kept the overall design under $60 while winning the most creative machine in class. From the project I learned how
            to work with team members you've never met before.
          </p>
          <p>ECEN 325 taught me circuit analysis. The course taught me how to work with Bode plots, diodes, op-amps, BJTs, and MOSFETs.
            What I enjoyed most about the course is that lab revolves around using a kit to construct circuits that we have solved for the transfer function, Bode plots, and components at certain frequencies.
            Last week we solved for and constructed second order lowpass, highpass, and bandpass filters and measured input and output using WaveForms. Simulations were created and tested on MultiSim then compared with the actuals.
          </p>
          <p>In ECEN 454, another course I'm currently taking, we are focused on digital integrated circuit design. The course currently revolves around creating simple circuit components like a NAND or XOR gate from the transistor level
            using pMOS and nMOS. We are currently designing these components in Cadence.
