        <h1>Maroon & White Leadership</h1>
          <p>Fall 2018 to Spring 2020 I was part of the Maroon & White Leadership Fellows (sponsored by the Division of Student Affairs) to improve my ability to reflect on my actions and learn about the the theoretical side
          of leadership.
          Throughout my time in the organization, I attended monthly meetings learning about different types leadership and what it truly means to be a leader.
          I reflected on 6 of my leadership experiences, including the Singing Cadets and MSC leadership experiences, alongside my fantastic mentor Aaron Klein.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reflection allowed me to look back with humility, accept mistakes made in the past, and thoughtfully focus on how to improve my communication and leadership style.
          Through my time in the program, I learned to admit that I make mistakes, reflect on situations to stand confidently behind an answer, and always look for the best interest of teammates.
          Once completing the requirements, I graduated from the Maroon & White Fellows to the Maroon & White Leadership Society and received my leadership certificate from Texas A&M University.
              The committee website with more information can be found <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>.

          <h1>MSC Bethancourt</h1>
            <p> April 2018 to May 2019 I served as the chair of MSC Bethancourt, a now out of commission committee of 24 that focuses on cross-disciplinary professional development and teaching
                students out of the box thinking. Over the past year we have had two major programs. The first is Laughing in the Face of Adversity with Shayla Rivera,
                a former NASA engineer, comedian, and current professor. The other major program was the annual MSC Bethancourt Symposium, where the committee brought
                Matthew Luhn, one of the 12 original animators of Pixar.

          <h1>MSC Fall Leadership Conference</h1>
            <p>December 2017 to September 2018 I served as chair of the MSC Fall Leadership Conference, a 3-day leadership retreat where the top TAMU student leaders
                learn leadership skills and network with powerful figures around campus. As chair, I oversaw the entire program, which ran on a $19,000 budget
                with a team of 6 sophomores and juniors. We had 75 students at the event with one student who flew in from Qatar just to attend the conference.

        <h1>Singing Cadets</h1>
          <p>The Texas A&M Singing Cadets is an all-male choir that serves as a public relations organization for Texas A&M University.
              In the Singing Cadets I served as the new member representative Spring 2018. Fall 2018 to Fall 2019 I was a mentor to new members after being welcomed into the group as an older memeber.
              As a mentor, I served as a guide to the
              new members on the culture of the organization and proper mannerisms, especially when visiting host homes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Texas A&M Singing Cadets was the best organization I stumbled upon in my college career.
              From the group, I learned to serve as an ambassador for something bigger than myself.
              During my time in the group, I traveled to approximately 40 U.S. cities over Texas, Washington, and Seattle. Internationally, I had the privilege to travel to Canada, Greece, and Bulgaria.

            </p>
            <p>
              Large scale performances include the One Relief Appeal concert were we had the honor of performing next to the 5 former presidents of the United States of America and the Houston Gospel Choir.
              We had the privilege of performing for the funeral of former president George H.W. Bush the day he was laid to rest in Aggieland.
              We also performed for the American Airlines Skyball, a large-scale dinner raising money for veteran-related causes and the distinguished alumni gala each year.
              In total we have approximately 100 performances a year that we balanced with our schoolwork and other involvements on campus.
            </p>
          <p>
              In addition to gaining these great life experiences, I also sharpened my own character and moral sword.
              In the organization, you learn to embody the core values of Texas A&M University, Exellence, Integrity, Leadership, Loyalty, Respect, and Selfless Service.
              Its from my time in the group that I developed into a leader and a gentlemen of character who serves for a purpose higher than oneself.

        <h1>MSC OPAS</h1>
          <p>My Junior year at Texas A&M I was involved with MSC OPAS, an MSC committee that brings the arts to Texas A&M University through Broadway performances and theatrics.
          My time in the committee involved helping usher patrons to their seat, mentoring new members, and fulfilling other duties as required. This included working with elementary students
          to guide them to and from their bus and assisting with marketing for each performance. The committee website with more information can be found <a href="http://opas.tamu.edu" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <h1>Polish Student Association</h1>
          <p>I have been part of the Texas A&M Polish Student Association (TAMPA) for over two years now. I joined because of my love for polish culture.
            Within the organization, I've learned about history of Poland, how polish culture differs from America, and eaten delicacies from the region.
            I've also had the opportunity to make friends from Poland and teach them about how great Texas A&M is.
