          <h1>MSC Fall Leadership Conference</h1>
            <p>I have just wrapped up my term as chair of the MSC Fall Leadership Conference, a 3-day leadership retreat where the top TAMU student leaders
                learn leadership skills and network with powerful figures around campus. As chair, I oversaw the entire program, which ran on a $19,000 budget
                and a team of 6 sophomores.

        <h1>Singing Cadets</h1>
          <p>The Texas A&M Singing Cadets is an all-male choir that serves as a public relations organization for Texas A&M University.
              In the Singing Cadets I served as the new member representative Spring 2018. Now I serve as a mentor within the group. As a mentor, I serve as a guide to the
              new members on how they should behave, especially when visiting host homes. New members learn values of servce by serving the group as probationary members for a year.
              Afterwards, they are voted on by the members of the group whether they can become full members. You can learn more about the Texas A&M Singing Cadets <a href="singingcadets.tamu.edu">here</a>.

        <h1>Polish Student Association</h1>
          <p>I have been part of the Texas A&M Polish Student Association (TAMPA) for over a year now. I joined because my love for the polish culture.
            Within the organization, I've learned about history of Poland, how polish culture differs from America, and eaten delicacies from the region.
            I've also had the opportunity to make friends from Poland and teach them about how great Texas A&M is!
