        <p>Howdy! I'm Clay.</p>
        <!--<img src="/images/clay3.JPG" alt="Headshot of Clay Ozuna" class="resize">-->
        <p>
            I'm an electrical engineer, aspiring translator, and photographer.
            I'm passionate about hands-on electrical projects, global events, and sociology.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated May 8th, 2020 from Texas A&M University with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering.
          I spent my summer studying for the NCEES Fundamentals of Engineering exam, which I took and passed September 1, 2020.
          Currently, I'm looking for a job related to small-signal circuit analysis or power systems.

        </p>
          <p>
              In my free time during the global pandemic, I enjoy playing football (soccer), League of Legends, and repurposing circuits from old appliances.
              I also enjoy photography. All of the images on this website were taken by me on my travels with my iPhone 6s.

              Throughout my life, I've always had a creative outlet through either band or the Texas A&M Singing Cadets.
              August 2020, I realized I needed to have a creative outlet now that I was done with school, so I have been learning the guitar since.
              I have learned a few songs, such as Senorita by Shawn Mendes and Sweet Home Alabama by Lynyrd Skynyrd that I will upload in time.
              True to my roots, I've also been branching into Flamenco. As I continue improving, I will upload videos.
            </p>
            <p>
              I became interested in playing soccer during my study abroad to Qatar.
              During tryouts for the Texas A&M Soccer team, I was amazed with the skill displayed by my teammates.
              I wanted to become a talented player with full control of the ball, so I purchased a pair of football boots and a soccer ball.
              Since then, I go out and play every day for at least 30 minutes and tune in to Barcelona games. Its a great, fun way to stay active and improve my playing, and meet people I would have never interacted with before.
