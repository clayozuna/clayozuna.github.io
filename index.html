          <p>
              I'm a Texas A&M Singing Cadet, MSC Officer, and researcher.
              I'm passionate about web development,
              renewable energy and how it can be implemented into the grid,
              and community involvement.
          </p>
          <p>
              Currently, I'm a Senior at Texas A&M University
              studying Electrical Engineering with a focus in power.
              Once I graduate, I hope to find a job in Chicago with a focus in renewable energy.
          </p>
          <p>
              During Summer 2018,
              I worked as a pilot student
              evaluating the newest freshman engineering courses.
              I have been conducting research mapping the power grid in the
              Bryan/College Station area and utilizing electric vehicles for peak shaving.
              In addition, I am leading MSC Bethancourt, an MSC committee focused on
              cross-disciplinary professionalism.

              I became involved with research Spring 2018 because I wanted to put skills
              learned from the classroom to use. Research has been a great way
              for me to gain a hands-on experience in Power Engineering.
              Outside of research, I've had many projects like
              building a Jungle Gym for preschoolers that helped me grow my
              teamwork and leadership skills or leading the MSC Fall Leadership Conference,
              a 3-day leadership conference with student leaders from across campus.

                I enjoy taking photos of architecture and landscapes when I'm on the move.
                 Here are some photos I've taken on my travels:

          <p>
              I believe that being involved in organizations is a great way to
              make new friends, learn skills not taught in class, and grow as a person.
              During my time at Texas A&M, I have been a part of several organizations
              that have given back to the community. My current involvement includes
              MSC Bethancourt, Texas A&M Polish Student Association, and the Texas A&M Singing Cadets.
