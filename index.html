              I'm an electrical engineer, aspiring translator, and photographer.
              I'm passionate about hands-on electrical projects, global events, and sociology.

              <!--I'm a Texas A&M Singing Cadet, Researcher, and coder.
              I'm passionate about web development,
              renewable energy,
              and community involvement.-->

          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated May 8th, 2020 from Texas A&M University with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering.
            I spent my summer studying for the NCEES Fundamentals of Engineering exam, which I took and passed September 1, 2020.
            Currently, I'm looking for a job related to small-signal circuit analysis or power systems.

          </p>
          <p>
              During Summer 2019, I was an Electrical Engineering intern with Mortenson on a wind turbine farm in Maryville, MO.
              I made the most of my internship, learning from the substation electrical engineer about assembly and analysis.
              I also learned from craft workers and field engineers about the timeline of a wind turbine, from site mapping to energization.

              During the pandemic and after my exam, I've been applying what I've learned in the classroom around the house.
              Using my Raspberry Pi, I was able to reset the computer on my car and pass the state inspection.
              I've also been building an electrical engineering workbench and installing GFCI outlets to ensure the house is safe.
          </p>
          <p>
              In Spring 2018, I became involved in research under Dr. Davis to learn about applying my power systems knowledge using Matlab.
              Outside of that, I've helped build a Jungle Gym for special needs children, developed a Rube Goldberg machine on AutoCAD, and helped run a charity fundraiser for families impacted by pediatric cancer.

                I enjoy taking photos of architecture and landscapes when I'm on the move.
                 Here are some photos I've taken on my travels:

              I believe that being involved in organizations is a great way to
              make new friends, learn skills not taught in class, and grow as a person.
              During my time at Texas A&M, I have been a part of several organizations
              that have allowed me to selflessly serve the community and discover myself.
              Some organizations I was a part of were the Texas A&M Singing Cadets, MSC Fall Leadership Conference, and the Maroon & White Leadership Society.
