          <p>Howdy! I'm clay.</p>
          <img src="/images/clay2.png" alt="Headshot of Clay Ozuna" class="resize">
          <p>
              I'm a Texas A&M Singing Cadet, MSC Officer, and researcher.
              I'm passionate about traveling the world, running, and leadership.
          </p>
          <p>Currently, I'm a Senior at Texas A&M University
              studying Electrical Engineering with a focus in power.
              Once I graduate, I hope to find a job in Chicago.
          </p>
          <p>During Summer 2018,
              I worked as a pilot student
              evaluating the newest freshman engineering courses.
              I have been conducting research
              mapping power transmission, distribution, and
              the impact of electric vehicles on the grid.
              I have also been leading the MSC Fall Leadership Conference.

            <p>
                I enjoy taking photos of architecture and landscapes. I like to look at my surroundings from different perspectives.
                All photos that you'll find on the website were taken by me. Here are some examples:

      <div id ="organizations">
        <h1>Organizational involvement</h1>
          <p>
              I believe that being involved in organizations is a great way to
              make new friends, learn skills not taught in class, and grow as a person.
              During my time at Texas A&M, I have been a part of several organizations
              that have given back to the community.
