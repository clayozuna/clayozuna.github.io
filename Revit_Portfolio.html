        <h1>Introduction</h1>
<!---->
        <p>
            After my interview October 7th, I decided to work on a project that would give me some experience with Revit.
            The easiest option was modeling my home, which I decided to build over the weekend. Because of my previous experience working with AutoCAD and Autodesk Inventor,
            I found the transition into Revit fairly simple.
        </p>
        <p>The remainder of the page is my thought process from project start to finish and lessons learned.

      <div id="foundation">
          <h1>Part 1: The Pre-model Process</h1>
            </p>
            <p>
              The first hurdle I faced in the project was determining how I was going to access the software.
              After some searching, I realized that it could be accessed through the Texas A&M Virtual Open Access Lab.
              Upon opening the software, I was quickly overwhelmed at the different project options available.
              I spent my Friday watching Revit tutorials from MEP engineers and Architects on YouTube.
              I followed along as they walked me through the software and several small-scale projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Saturday, feeling confident in my ability, I decided to get started with the project.
              With the help of my mother, I dimensioned the entire house.
              Figure 1 is an example of the measurements taken as we went around the perimeter.

            </p>
              <img src = "../images/dimensions.jpg" class="resize" id="dimension"
        alt = "Picture of house dimensions" />
        <p id="img-text"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Perimeter and Interior Dimensions
            </p>
            <h1>Part 2: Modeling in Revit</h1>
            <p>
              With the perimeter dimensioned, I went to work building the model.
              I used a south-facing foundation with a top plate 8'0" above the finished floor level.
              Once the perimeter was modeled using brick wall and sheetrock, I dimensioned the interior, putting in walls as I went.
              Inside, I used basic 8" walls. Afterwards, I put in doors and windows corresponding with measurements taken.
              Wanting to make the final product more presentable, I partitioned each area into rooms and used Revit to develop a legend, as shown in figure 2 below.
            </p>
            <p>

        alt = "Picture of house dimensions" />
        <p id="img-text"><strong>Figure 2: </strong>Modeled Home Floor with Legend</p>
              I also put in furniture closely resembling the current layout of the house.
              To tie out the foundational work, I installed ceilings almost exactly resembling the current state of the house.
            </p>

      <div id="Electrical">
        <h1>Part 3: Determining Home Circuits</h1>
        <p>
          After completing the foundation, I needed to determine which outlets were wired to which circuit breaker.
          To do this, I would turn off a breaker and make note of what turned off in the house one by one.
          My notes can be found in figure 3.
        </p>
          <img src = "../images/circuitpanel+circuit.PNG" class="resize"
    alt = "Picture of circuit panel and wirings" />
    <p id="img-text"><strong>Figure 3: </strong>Circuit Breaker Panel and Related Areas</p>
        <h1>Part 4: Modeling in Revit</h1>
        <p>
          Modeling the electrical system was a fairly simple process.
          I understood what Andrew meant when he said it was more of a 3-D building process during this step.
          It was important to not only place the outlet or switch on the right plane, but also at the right height.
          At this point, I went around the house with my laptop measuring the placement of each outlet or switch and modeling it.
          Though tricky, I was able to find a workaround for the living area and kitchen lights that were placed on a 5"/12" sloped ceiling.

        </p>
        <p>
          Once everything including the panelboard was placed, I wired and named each circuit in accordance to the label on the circuit breaker panel.
          Switches were also wired to their respective lights.
          Each circuit used arced wiring since the wiring was hidden in the walls. Figure 4 shows the final top-down view of the electrical circuit.

      <div id="Conclusion">
        <h1>Lessons Learned and Future Work</h1>
        <p>
          Overall, I found this was an excellent project to get experience using Revit.
          From this, I was able to model the structure of a home and install power systems.
          Due to the virtual open access lab software and personal knowledge limitations, I ran into a couple issues during modeling.
</p>
          <p>The first issue was not having all of the electrical devices, such as appliances and materials to make a finished model.
          The second issue faced was not being able to model the home exactly due to the 1965 national electrical codes used. The home was built to 1965 NFPA 70 codes.
          This edition of the national electrical codes did not include the 80% limitation of the branch-circuit ampere rating.
          The third major issue faced was that saves were originally placed in the virtual computer. When disconnected, all data was lost.
          This resulted in me losing half a day of work. Thankfully, it also gave me more experience having to repeat the work over again.
          <!--Given my construction experience with craft members, I was able to understand how a system might make sense to an engineer but not the people constructing the home.
          For example-->
        </p>
        <p>
          In the future, once I have more experience, I would like to revisit this model to add, HVAC, Plumbing, and finishing touches.
          I believe with a bit more training in the Revit, I can make a highly polished model.
