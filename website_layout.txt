This is my plan for how the website will be laid out.

At the top:
	1. There will be a navigation bar that allows me to come home and link to other 
internal pages. --- COMPLETE

Beneath the navigation bar:
	1. There will be a banner picture that will have my name as well. --- 
COMPLETE
	2. The name introduction will have my name styled and possibly a 
greeting. --- COMPLETE

Beneath the banner:
	1. There will be a greeting so people learn who I am. --- COMPLETE
Beneath the about me introduction section:
	1. Give a quick overview of research project.
	2. Link to a page where a more in-depth overview can be given.
Beneath the research section:
	1. Ending where a footer will be included.
