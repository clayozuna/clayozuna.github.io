        <p>Howdy! I'm Clay.</p>
        <!--<img src="/images/clay3.JPG" alt="Headshot of Clay Ozuna" class="resize">-->
        <p>
            I'm an electrical engineer, aspiring translator, and photographer.
            I'm passionate about hands-on electrical projects, global events, and sociology.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated May 8th, 2020 from Texas A&M University with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering.
          I spent my summer studying for the NCEES Fundamentals of Engineering exam, which I took and passed September 1, 2020.
          Currently, I'm looking for a job related to small-signal circuit analysis or power systems.

        </p>
        <p>
            During Summer 2019, I was an Electrical Engineering intern with Mortenson on a wind turbine farm in Maryville, MO.
            I made the most of my internship, learning from the substation electrical engineer about assembly and analysis.
            I also learned from craft workers and field engineers about the timeline of a wind turbine, from site mapping to energization.

        </p>
        <p>
            In Spring 2018, I became involved in research under Dr. Davis to learn about applying my power systems knowledge using Matlab.
            In our research, we developed a simulation of the grid of the Bryan/College Station area in Matlab. Then, simulating a blackout, we tested the feasibility of using electric vehicles to help restart the grid.
            My partner Claire and I used the project as our capstone to write our senior thesis, present findings, and become Undergraduate Research Scholars.
        </p>
          <p>
              During Spring and Summer 2018, I had a hand in shaping the Texas A&M freshman engineering cirriculm. I worked as a pilot student (recommend by professors)
              evaluating and providing feedback on new freshman engineering courses that were implemented Fall 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
              Throughout my time at Texas A&M, I had the opportunity to study abroad twice. Summer 2017 I studied Electric & Magnetic fields and Random Signals & Systems at RWTH University in Germany.
              During Spring 2020, I finished my degree at Texas A&M University at Qatar.
          </p>
          <p>
              In addition to electrical engineering I have taken courses in business and entrepreneurship to round out my education.
              I was also heavily involved with organizations like the Texas A&M Singing Cadets and the MSC to ensure I learned skills not taught in the classroom, such as communication and team dynamics.
          </p>
          <p>
              I was born and raised in Houston, TX and am a proud graduate from Clear Lake High school.
              Throughout High school, I was part of the Fighting Falcon Band and the tennis team.
              Through Project Lead the Way (PLTW), I was able to take engineering courses throughout High school ranging from aerospace engineering to architecture.
              Through PLTW, I had exposure to soldering circuits, using AutoCAD, and capstone projects well before entering college.
          </p>
          <p>
              In my free time during the global pandemic, I enjoy playing football (soccer), League of Legends, and repurposing circuits from old appliances.
              I also enjoy photography. All of the images on this website were taken by me on my travels with my iPhone 6s.
          </p>

          <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout my life, I've always had a creative outlet through either band or the Texas A&M Singing Cadets.
              August 2020, I realized I needed to have a creative outlet now that I was done with school, so I have been learning the guitar since.
              I have learned a few songs, such as Senorita by Shawn Mendes and Sweet Home Alabama by Lynyrd Skynyrd that I will upload in time.
              True to my roots, I've also been branching into Flamenco. As I continue improving, I will upload videos.
            </p>
            <p>
              I became interested in playing soccer during my study abroad to Qatar.
              During tryouts for the Texas A&M Soccer team, I was amazed with the skill displayed by my teammates.
              I wanted to become a talented player with full control of the ball, so I purchased a pair of football boots and a soccer ball.
              Since then, I go out and play every day for at least 30 minutes and tune in to Barcelona games. Its a great, fun way to stay active and improve my playing, and meet people I would have never interacted with before.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have been passionate about cooking since I took a cooking class in middle school. I see it as an edible artform.
              Since I can't physically travel due to the global pandemic, I've been bringing cultures around the world to me in the kitchen.
              I've made are Koshari, the national dish of Egypt.
              I've also made Perogi from Poland, Macarons from France, and Creamy Tuscany Chicken from Italy, to name a few.
            </p>
            <p>
              Becasue of my upbringing, my first language was Spanish.
              It was commonly spoken around the house with my grandparents growing up, allowing me to be fluent in both English and Spanish.
              Since 2018, I've been working on adding Russian to my toolkit around my schoolwork.
              I enjoy the culture and have fun learning an alphabet outside the Latin script.
              Now that I have graduated, this is my primary task I work on. I am translating the 1000 most common words between all three languages.
              The plan is to reach CFER B2 proficiency in Russian and C1 proficiency in Spanish by the end of 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
              During Spring 2020, I took advantage of my location in Qatar to travel around the Middle East.
              The original plan was to visit Oman and Egypt with some friends, but a last minute change was made after Oman announced their first coronavirus case days before my stay.
              Instead, I rerouted a solo flight to Dubai, UAE. Through Airbnb, I stayed in the 45th floor of a high rise on Jumeriah Beach for the week.
              I had a great time blending in like a local riding the subway and visiting hot tourist spots like the Burj Khalifa, mall of Dubai, and Atlantis at the Palm.
              Throughout my trip, I befriended several people and learned top-tier cooking skills from the Dubai College of Tourism at the Dubai Food Expo 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
              Summer 2018 I had the opportunity to study abroad in Germany. I studied Electromagnetics and Random Signals and Systems
              at RWTH, a university in Western Germany. During free time, I traveled to the Netherlands, Poland, Scotland, and the Czech Republic.
              Most memorable was my first ever solo cross-country train trip from Western Germany to Southern Poland that I organized.
              I met several people along the way that I still keep in contact with.
              It was incredible seeing thousands of years of culture across those 4 countries and living life as a local without a specific schedule.
            </p>
            <p>I have been coding ever since I was young, working with LEGO Mindstorm robots and going up from there. In highschool, I took 5 PLTW engineering
                courses where I learned how to work with VEX robotics in addition to other engineering fundamentals in aerospace, civil, and electrical enginering.
                In college I learned HTML, CSS, C++, Matlab, and Python the first couple of years.
            </p>
            <p>
               In Spring 2019, I participated in TAMUhack, sponsored by Major League Hacking (MLH).
               It was a great environment to practice my coding amongst a great community of friends.
               I spent my time coding on a Qualcomm DragonBoard 410c Development Board, gaining an ample amount of experience with the terminal.
            </p>
            <p>
               Fall 2019, I participated in the world's first ever Datathon, sponsored by Facebook and MLH to name a few.
               The program was put together by a fellow peer of mine, Josiah Coad, who wanted to make machine learning simple enough to understand.
               By the end of the event, I was highly confident in my abilities to work on Jupyter, a web-based IDE.
               I became proficient in data manipulation and visualization in an attempt to minimize loss using Pandas, Seaborn, and NumPy to name a few.
               Since then, I have developed a program that maps the frequency and location of COVID-19 cases across Texas, which will be uploaded to Github in the near future.
