          <p>
              Howdy! I'm Clay Ozuna, a software developer, runner, and world traveler.
              I'm passionate about website development, being involved on campus, and photography.
          </p>
          <p>
              Currently I'm a senior at Texas A&M University studying Electrical Engineering
              with a focus in power.
          </p>
          <p>
              During summer 2018, I worked as a pilot student at Texas A&M University
              evaluating the newest freshman engineering courses that will be implemented Fall 2018.
              I have also been working with my team to put on the 66th MSC Fall Leadership Conference while taking classes.
              Last summer I studied Electric & Magnetic fields and Random Signals & Systems at RWTH University in Germany.
          </p>
          <p>
              At Texas A&M, I am Chair of the MSC Fall Leadership Conference & MSC Bethancourt.
              I am a Texas A&M Singing Cadet and a member of the Texas A&M Polish Student Association.
              I also study under Dr. Kate Davis as an undergraduate researcher on the Cyber-Physical Modeling & Assessment team.
              In addition to electrical engineering, power, and music, I have taken courses in business and entrepreneurship.
          </p>
          <p>
              I was born and raised in Houston, TX and graduated from Clear Lake High School. During my high school time, I took
              several engineering courses and played trombone in the Clear Lake Falcon Band.
          </p>
          <p>
              In my free time, I enjoy traveling the world, photography, learning french, coding, swimming, and investing in startups.
