          <p>
              Howdy! I'm Clay Ozuna, a software developer, runner, and world traveler.
              I'm passionate about website development, being involved on campus, and photography.
          </p>
          <p>
              Currently I'm a senior at Texas A&M University studying Electrical Engineering
              with a focus in power.
          </p>
          <p>
              During summer 2018, I worked as a pilot student at Texas A&M University
              evaluating the newest freshman engineering courses that will be implemented Fall 2018.
              I have also been working with my team to put on the 66th MSC Fall Leadership Conference while taking classes.
              Last summer I studied Electric & Magnetic fields and Random Signals & Systems at RWTH University in Germany.
          </p>
          <p>
              At Texas A&M, I am Chair of MSC Bethancourt & former chair of the MSC Fall Leadership Conference.
              I am a Texas A&M Singing Cadet and a member of the Texas A&M Polish Student Association.
              I also study under Dr. Kate Davis as an undergraduate researcher on the Cyber-Physical Modeling & Assessment team.
              In addition to electrical engineering, power, and music, I have taken courses in business and entrepreneurship to round out my education.
          </p>
          <p>
              I was born and raised in Houston, TX and graduated from Clear Lake High School. During my high school time, I took
              several engineering courses and played trombone in the Clear Lake Falcon Band.
          </p>
          <p>
              In my free time, I enjoy running, traveling the world, and coding. I also enjoy photography. All of the images on the website were taken by me on my travels.

      <div id="hobbies">
          <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
            <p>When I'm not working on schoolwork, you can find me either coding, learning about other cultures, or running.
                I am currently signed up to run the ULTRA 55 in December, put on by the Snowdrop Foundation to raise
                money towards pediatric cancer research.
            </p>
            <p>Summer 2018 I had the opportunity to study abroad in Germany. I studied Electromagnetics and Random Signals and Systems
                at RWTH, a university in Western Germany. During free time, I traveled to the Netherlands, Poland, Scotland, and the Czech Republic.
                Most memorable was a solo cross-country train trip from Western Germany to Southern Poland that I organized on my own. I met several people
                along the way, some I still keep in contact with.
            </p>
            <p>I have been coding ever since I was young, working with LEGO Mindstorm robots and going up from there. In highschool, I took 5 PLTW engineering
                courses where I learned how to work with VEX robotics in addition to other engineering fundamentals in aerospace, civil, and electrical enginering.
                In college I learned HTML, CSS, C++, Matlab, and Python the first couple of years. Now, I am branching out and experimenting with Javascript while refining
                what I currently know.
